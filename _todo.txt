Blue ghost bug
--------------
Ghosts turn blue for one frame in later levels instead of only reversing direction.


Possible wraparound bug
-----------------------
The upper-left corner of the maze is considered (0, 0). This can cause underflows with Inky's and Pinky's logic. Do not fix this bug until looking into the next bug.

With the previous bug, when Pac-Man is at the very top of the maze and facing up, Pinky's target square should go way below the bottom of the maze. This means Pinky should retreat to the bottom in this situation. He does not. Thus, while Pinky *looks* like he's behaving sensibly by staying near Pac-Man, there may be a bug in his steering. The steering algo uses quasi-signed numbers, though; maybe an overflow winds up correcting the issue.

I'm not sure the two bugs fully cancel out; Pinky's score for "northish" might be too high. If so, this would remove "westish" and "eastish" from the steering computation.


Killer scared ghosts
--------------------
(5:24:02 AM) furrykef: wow, that was weird
(5:24:20 AM) furrykef: I was playing it myself and I ate an energizer and collided with a ghost on the same frame
(5:24:26 AM) furrykef: The ghost turned blue and I died anyway


This bug might or might not exist in the current build. (Seems doubtful that it does, but haven't formally tested it.)


To be implemented
-----------------
Sprite overflow check

Do eaten ghosts ever reverse direction with mode changes?

If we add two-player play, don't forget that the ghosts' dot counters need to be associated with each player.

Initialize random seed better.

Can Pac-Man's rendering logic be merged with the ghosts'?
