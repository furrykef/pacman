Death noise
-----------
Hi-pitch envelope in FT:
| -1 -1 0 -1 -1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 

With F#4 or around there gives a decent approximation. Could do some time measurements on the original sound to get a better estimate of how long to rise and how far to fall.


Fright
------
The fright times in the Pac-Man Dossier are exact; there are no fractions of seconds involved.

When flashing: 14 frames to change from blue to white or vice versa, but white to normal may take less than 14 frames (9 frames on level 1, 6 on level 2).


Intermissions
-------------
First intermission is after level 2, second after level 5, third after level 9 and every four levels thereafter.
