Fright
------
The fright times in the Pac-Man Dossier are exact; there are no fractions of seconds involved.

When flashing: 14 frames to change from blue to white or vice versa, but white to normal may take less than 14 frames (9 frames on level 1, 6 on level 2).


LZSS
----
This can be used for both the maze and music patterns.

<furrykef> I just realized I don't need local OAM or the display list while decompressing LZSS, so one of them can double as the LZSS sliding window buffer.
<furrykef> So that saves 256 bytes of RAM.


Sprite zero hit
---------------
Sprite zero hits can't be detected while sprite rendering is disabled. To hide the ghosts in the status bar, we do the following:
  * Use foreground black for the bottom row of the status area.
  * Flip sprite priority on ghosts that overlap this area.
  * Use 8x8 sprites so at most 7 pixels of the ghost will be drawn behind dots.

However, using 8x8 sprites will probably break the sprite overflow flag at least some of the time.
