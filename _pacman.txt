Fright
------
The fright times in the Pac-Man Dossier are exact; there are no fractions of seconds involved.

When flashing: 14 frames to change from blue to white or vice versa, but white to normal may take less than 14 frames (9 frames on level 1, 6 on level 2).


LZSS
----
This can be used for both the maze and music patterns.

<furrykef> I just realized I don't need local OAM or the display list while decompressing LZSS, so one of them can double as the LZSS sliding window buffer.
<furrykef> So that saves 256 bytes of RAM.


Intermissions
-------------
First intermission is after level 2, second after level 5, third after level 9 and every four levels thereafter.
